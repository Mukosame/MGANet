## Installation
The code was developed using Python 3.6 & PyTorch 0.4 & CUDA 8.0. There may be a problem related to software versions. To fix the problem, you may look at the implementation in MGANet files and replace the syntax to match the new PyTorch environment. 

## Code v1.0
Currently, we release our research code for testing. It should produce the same results as in the paper under LD and AI configurations and frame number 3.
## Test
* Pretrained models can be downloaded from this link!
```

```
* It would be very easy to understand the test function and test on your own data.
* An example of test usage is shown as follows:
```bash 
python MGANet_test_AI37.py --gpu_id 1
```
## Train and Data
* We will update the training code and database for TUs' partition of compressed video by HEVC for training and better reading after recent paper deadline.
## Video Results
* [Here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09150) we provide quality enhancement results of compressed video for 18 widely used sequences for visual and quantitative comparisons.
